# Stock News Alert

This Python script uses the Alpha Vantage API to monitor stock prices and the News API to fetch news articles related to a specific company. It then sends the top news articles to a specified phone number using Twilio.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- requests library (install using pip install requests)
- twilio library (install using pip install twilio)

## Setup
1. Obtain API keys for Alpha Vantage and News API.
2. Create a Twilio account and obtain your Account SID, Auth Token, and a Twilio phone number.

## Configuration
- Set the following variables in the script:
    - STOCK_NAME: The stock symbol to monitor (e.g., "TSLA" for Tesla Inc).
    - COMPANY_NAME: The name of the company corresponding to the stock symbol.
    - STOCK_API_KEY: Your API key from Alpha Vantage.
    - NEWS_API_KEY: Your API key from News API.
    - TWILIO_SID: Your Twilio Account SID.
    - TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN: Your Twilio Auth Token.
    - VIRTUAL_TWILIO_NUMBER: Your virtual Twilio number.
    - VERIFIED_NUMBER: Your own phone number verified with Twilio.

## Usage
1. Run the script stock_news_alert.py.
2. The script will fetch the stock's closing prices for the last two days and calculate the percentage change.
3. If the percentage change exceeds a threshold (currently set to 1%), the script will fetch the top 3 news articles related to the company.
4. Each article's headline and description will be sent as a separate message to your phone number via Twilio.

## Note
- Ensure that you have sufficient credits or a paid subscription for the Alpha Vantage and News API services.
- Check the usage limits and pricing details for Twilio to avoid unexpected charges.

Feel free to customize the script further based on your requirements or add error handling for robustness.
